### `most_frequent` Function

This function, named `most_frequent`, takes a vector of integers as input and returns the number that appears most frequently in the vector. If multiple numbers have the same highest frequency, the function returns one of them arbitrarily.

#### Key Features:
- **Input**: A vector of integers.
- **Output**: The integer with the highest occurrence.
- If multiple integers have the same frequency, the function will return one of them.

#### Example:

Given the input vector `[1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3]`, the function will return `3`, since it appears the most times in the vector.

This function can be useful for applications where you need to find the mode (the most frequent value) in a list of numbers. The function ensures efficiency and handles ties by returning any one of the numbers with the highest frequency.
